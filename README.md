# moodle-mod_subheader
Moodle module allowing for subheaders to be added as text in sections. The purpose of this is to provide greater organization of activities within a section (topic or week).

You might ask why create such a module since the label module is so similar. The label module allows for html in the name. This does not. This allows for greater consistency when styling the header using CSS.

Once case scenario for using the subheader is when you want to have units that breakdown into lessons. You could use the Moodle course sections (topics) as the unit. Within the section, you can add a subheader for each of the different lessons. Under each lesson, you can add the different activities or resources.
